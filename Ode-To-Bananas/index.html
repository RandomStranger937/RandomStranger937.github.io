		<h1>An Ode to Bananas</h1>
		
		<h2>For Kayla</h2>
	
		<p> Bananas are like a summers moon, <br />
		soft, yet bright&mdash; <br />
		colorful and delicate. </p>

		<p> They are edible boomerangs. <br />
		A magnificent fruit, <br />
		inside a single peel. <br />
		Its peel is its blanket. <br />
		A masterpiece in itself&mdash; <br />
		Picked from the glorious banana palm. </p>

		<p> They dance about in the fruit basket <br />
		complimenting all other fruits. <br />
		Their color matches everything. <br />
		Cure for crazy cravings, <br />
		silly, spotty, <br />
		screaming to be eaten. </p>

		<p> They are like the key to all happiness. <br />
		They make children laugh, <br />
		sing, and play. <br />
		Boost your metabolism. </p>

		<p> Bananas are leopards <br />
		in the world of fruits. <br />
		Their spots look
		appealing, yet dangerous <br />
		yet on the inside, <br />
		they are still like kittens. </p>

		<p> Bananas are essential <br />
		to a healthy life. </p>

		<p> Ode <br />
		to <br />
		Bananas </p>

		Lights the traveller in the dark,<br />
